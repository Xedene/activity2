        <h1>Ka Don-Mariano!</h1>
        <p>Greetings from <strong>Xedene Estipular</strong> and <strong>Paulo Subido</strong>, 
        the dynamic duo behind this website! We're both first-year college students at Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University,
        diving into the world of Information Technology with passion and determination.</p>
        <p>This website is the result of our shared enthusiasm for
         IT and a project that challenged us to apply our 
         classroom learning in a real-world context. 
         It's not just a website; it's a testament to 
         what two passionate individuals
         can achieve when they put their minds together.</p>
